Finding the Square Root of an Integer
For the calculation of this problem, the binary search tree approach was used in order to 
Obtain / recognize the approx square root of the integer. The expected time complexity of such
Data structure approach is O(log(n)) time.  The complexity of such is due to the intermission is 
constantly being splitter.
